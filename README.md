# DL-Assignment

Code for the Assignment of BITS F425 Deep Learning course

The following have been implemented:

- Assignment-1:
17 different Deep Neural Network models for a Multiclass Classification task are evaluated and compared. The models differ in hyperparameters such as -
  - Activation Functions in the hidden layers
    - Sigmoid
    - Tanh
    - ReLU
  - Loss Functions
    - Categorical Cross-Entropy
    - KL-Divergence
  - Number of Hidden Layers - 1 to 10
  - Number of Nodes in Hidden Layers - 16 to 1024

- Assignment-2:
A Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) for a Multiclass Classification task is run. The performance of the model is analyzed.
